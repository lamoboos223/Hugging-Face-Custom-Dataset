# Build Custom Synthetic Dataset


welcome to this project where we make a dataset using a large language model.

in this project we will have 2 models, one for generating the data and another one for rewarding the first model output.
we will use the reward model from nvidia and for generating a resopnse we will use llama series model.


### Used models

1. meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct
2. nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-reward
